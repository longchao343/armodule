ARModule contains marker detector filter utilizing ALVAR augmented reality library ie
ALVAR markers can be detected from the video image.
ARModule can render 2D and 3D augmentation with OpenCV and Irrlicht rendering engine above the detected ALVAR marker. ARModule can also and send events about markers to the Kurento Client.

The repository contains documentation for installing and utilising the ArModule. The repository contains description of the architecture of the ARModule and also the source code of the ARModule implementation.

**Alvar Markers**

Some Alvar markers can be found eg from [AlvarMarkers](https://github.com/nubomedia-vtt/armodule/tree/master/AlvarMarkers) 
Eg the zero marker is defined as MarkerData_0.png
